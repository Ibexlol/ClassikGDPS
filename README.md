Oh Coventry, city of grey,
Where boredom reigns both night and day,
No beauty to behold or see,
A place devoid of energy.

No hills to climb, no seas to swim,
No vibrant lights to lure one in,
Just endless rows of concrete walls,
A city lacking any thralls.

No bustling streets with markets grand,
No lively crowds to take a stand,
Just silence, quiet, and monotone,
A place where joy is seldom shown.

Oh Coventry, how dull you seem,
A city trapped in lifeless dream,
Where nothing much can captivate,
And boredom seems to permeate.
